# 🧠 CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to build a basic **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture using Python for image classification tasks. It serves as an educational example for those interested in getting started with deep learning and computer vision.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in image processing and pattern recognition tasks. The model in this project includes the following components:

- Convolutional layers  
- ReLU activation functions  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Fully Connected (Dense) layers  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Softmax output layer  

The model is trained on a sample dataset such as **MNIST** or **CIFAR-10** to classify images into predefined categories.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (based on implementation)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Installation
